## Next Implementation Steps

### Step 1.2: Firebase Setup
1. Create Firebase project: `elte-calendar`
2. Enable required services:
   - Authentication (Email/Password, Google, Apple)
   - Cloud Firestore
   - Firebase Storage
3. Update configuration files with real credentials
4. Configure security rules

### Step 2: Authentication System
- User registration and login
- Email verification (non-blocking)
- Google and Apple Sign-in
- Password reset functionality

### Step 3: Excel Import Feature  
- File picker for .xlsx files
- Excel validation and parsing
- Hungarian schedule format parsing:
  - Day abbreviations (H=Monday, K=Tuesday, SZE=Wednesday, CS=Thursday, P=Friday, SZ=Saturday)
  - Time slot extraction
  - Location parsing

### Step 4: Calendar Interface
- Daily, Weekly, Monthly views
- Course color coding by type
- Current time indicator
- Interactive course details

### Step 5: Semester Management
- Current/Next semester calculation
- Semester selection dropdown
- Data organization by semester

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
1. Flutter SDK installed and configured
2. Firebase project created and configured
3. Platform-specific setup (Android Studio for Android, Xcode for iOS)

### Commands
```bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on web
flutter run -d chrome

# Run on Android
flutter run -d android

# Run on iOS  
flutter run -d ios

# Build for production
flutter build web
flutter build apk
flutter build ios
```

## Firebase Configuration Required

Update these files with actual Firebase project credentials:
- `lib/config/firebase_config.dart`
- `android/app/google-services.json`
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
- `web/index.html` (Firebase config object)

## Development Notes

- All placeholder screens show development status and upcoming features
- Theme system is fully implemented with light/dark mode support
- Localization system supports Hungarian (default), English, and German
- Code follows Flutter best practices with comprehensive commenting
- Error handling framework is established throughout the codebase
- Responsive design considerations are built into the theme system

## Excel File Format Expected

The app will parse Excel files with these Hungarian column headers:
- **TÃ¡rgy kÃ³dja** (Course code)
- **TÃ¡rgy neve** (Course name)  
- **Kurzus kÃ³dja** (Class code)
- **Kurzus tÃ­pusa** (Class type)
- **Ã“raszÃ¡m:** (Weekly hours)
- **Ã“rarend infÃ³** (Schedule info)
- **OktatÃ³k** (Instructors)
- **VÃ¡rÃ³lista** (Waiting list - ignored)

Day abbreviation parsing:
- H = HÃ©tfÅ‘ (Monday)
- K = Kedd (Tuesday)
- SZE = Szerda (Wednesday)  
- CS = CsÃ¼tÃ¶rtÃ¶k (Thursday)
- P = PÃ©ntek (Friday)
- SZ = Szombat (Saturday)

## Contact & Development

This project follows the technical specification document exactly. Each implementation step must be completed fully before proceeding to the next step, with comprehensive testing and documentation.

Current Status: **Step 1.1 Complete** - Ready for Firebase setup and authentication implementation.
